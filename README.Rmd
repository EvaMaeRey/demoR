# demoR

<!-- badges: start -->
[![CRAN status](https://www.r-pkg.org/badges/version/demoR)](https://cran.r-project.org/package=demoR)

## Overview

demoR is a set of tools for formatting `R` code for presentations, teaching demonstrations, and much more:

* The `hlt_*()` functions add text display formatting to printed code.

* The `demo_*()` functions print and run the code.

These combine naturally within code chunks in R Markdown files via code chunk options. You can learn more about them in `vignette("demoR")`.

## Installation

<!--
```{r, eval = FALSE}
# The easiest way to get demoR is the basic installation:
install.packages("demoR")
```
Not on CRAN yet!
-->

### Development version

Currently, only the development version of demoR is available.  You can install this by running

```{r, eval = FALSE}
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("kbodwin/demoR")
```


## Usage

```{r, message = FALSE}
library(demoR)
data(iris)
codestring <- "mean(iris$Sepal.Length, na.rm = TRUE)"

hlt_funs(codestring)

hlt_args(codestring)

demo_code(codestring) %>% hlt_args()
```
